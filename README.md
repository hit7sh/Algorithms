# C

C is a Procedure/Structured Oriented Programming language.
And it not a great choice for programmers nowadays, but it gets most of the tasks done.

The Cons:
- Does not have a wide range of library functions, you are just limited to few primary functions
- Does not have STRINGS, aarrrghhh?! you have to manually make a character Array to store Strings.
- No boolean datatype
- No bound checking! if you have Array say, A[5] and you are trying to access A[7] the code will compile without any warnings,
  but it can be problematic as the non-valid indexes may be occupied by the system.
- Lacks Exception Handling.

The Pros:
- C is a fast language (faster than Java,Python,C++)
  it is because there is no runtime checking in C, no bound checking, and so on.
  
Feel free to add a c program!
